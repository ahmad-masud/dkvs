// It allows setting, getting, and deleting key-value pairs, as well as setting a value with a time-to-live (TTL).
// The interface is designed to be implemented by different storage backends, such as in-memory, Redis, or any other key-value store.
// The methods are designed to be simple and efficient, allowing for easy integration with various storage solutions.

// implement to provide snapshot and restore functionality used by Raft FSM.
